# Tostones (Puerto Rican Fried Plantains)

## Ingredients 

- 2 green plantains (you want them to be firm and mostly green)
- 1-2 cups oil for frying
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 cup water

## Instructions

Peel the plantains and slice them into 1 inch thick pieces. Place minced garlic in a bowl, add water and set aside.

Pour oil to frying pan about a half inch high in the pan then heat oil to 375 degrees. When the oil reaches 375 degrees add the plantains. Fry for 3 minutes (flip plantains halfway) until the plantains are slightly softened and browned. Remove using a slotted spoon or fork and place on a paper towel lined plate. Let cool until they are soft enough to handle.

Place the plantains on a cutting board, smash with the back of a wooden spoon to make them half as thick, and soak in the garlic water for about a minute.

Take them out and pat dry make sure to get rid of any excess water as this will splatter the oil also wipe off garlic pieces, so they donâ€™t burn.

Fry for another 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until they are a deep golden color. Set them on paper towels to remove the excess oil before serving.
