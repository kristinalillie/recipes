# Vegan chocolate cupcakes

## Ingredients

- 1 cup almond milk (can use soy, rice or hemp milk)
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup walnut oil (can use canola)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, chocolate extract, or more vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup cocoa powder, Dutch-processed or regular
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F and line a muffin tin with paper or foil liners.

Whisk together the almond milk and vinegar in a large bowl, and set aside for a few minutes to curdle. 

Add the sugar, oil, vanilla extract, and other extract, if using, to the almond milk mixture and beat until foamy. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add in two batches to wet ingredients and beat until no large lumps remain (a few tiny lumps are OK).

Pour into liners, filling 3/4 of the way. Bake 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.
