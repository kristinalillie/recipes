# Easy Falafel

- 1 can garbanzo beans, drained
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- 3/4 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons flour
- oil for frying (canola or vegetable)

## Instructions

Combine garbanzo beans, garlic, onion, coriander, cumin, salt and pepper (to taste) in medium bowl. Add flour and combine well.

Mash garbanzo beans, making sure to mix ingredients together. You can also combine ingredients in a food processor. You want the result to be a thick paste. 

Form the mixture into small balls, about the size of a ping pong ball. Slightly flatten.

Fry in 2 inches of oil at 350 degrees until golden brown (2-5 minutes).
