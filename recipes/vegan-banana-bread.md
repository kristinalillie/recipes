# Vegan banana bread

## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup vegan margarine
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 cups flour
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 2 ripe bananas, mashed
- 1/2 cup soy milk
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cream together the vegan margarine and sugar, then stir in the flour and baking powder and baking soda. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.

Pour into an oiled bread pan and bake for 50 minutes.

Tried this with 1/2 oat flour 1/4 soy and 1/4 garbanzo flour (soy sounds gluten free, but upon further research depending on how the soy is grown it may or may not be gluten-free. If the soy is grown on a crop rotated farm the soy may have gluten via cross contamination from growing in the same soil that wheat was previously grown on. For 100% gluten-free try half oat and half garbanzo flour).
