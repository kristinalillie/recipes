# Vegan vanilla cupcakes

Makes 12 cupcakes

## Ingredients

- 1 cup almond milk (can use soy, rice or hemp milk)
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup walnut oil (can use canola)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F and line a cupcake pan with paper or foil liners. Whisk together the almond milk and vinegar in a large bowl, and set aside for a few minutes to curdle. 

Add the sugar, oil, vanilla extract, to the almond milk mixture and beat until foamy. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add in two batches to wet ingredients and beat until no large lumps remain (a few tiny lumps are OK).

Pour into liners, filling 3/4 of the way. Bake 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.
