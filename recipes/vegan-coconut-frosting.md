# Vegan coconut frosting

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup unrefined (virgin) coconut oil
- 2 cups powdered sugar (may need more)
- 4-6 tablespoons coconut, almond, hemp, soy or rice milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

## Instructions

In an electric mixer cream the coconut oil until it breaks up and gets nice and smooth then add in 1/4 of the powdered sugar, the vanilla and 2 tablespoons of soy milk, mix together until nice and smooth. Continue to add the powdered sugar along with tablespoons of almond milk as needed until everything is combined. Make sure there are no clumps of powdered sugar or coconut oil. Make sure cake is cool or the frosting will melt. This frosting does not work well with cupcakes the frosting will pour over the side.
