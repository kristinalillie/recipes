# Guacamole

Makes 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 2 ripe avocados
- 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 1 Tbsp of lemon juice
- 2 Tbsp to 1/4 cup of minced red onion
- 2 tablespoons cilantro (leaves and tender stems), finely chopped
- A dash of freshly grated black pepper
- 1/2 ripe tomato

## Instructions

Slice avocados in half, remove seed and scoop out the center. Mash avocados with a fork in a medium bowl. Chop onion, cilantro and tomato then add to bowl. Add remaining ingredients and mix until smooth. As avocados oxidize they will turn brown, so make as close to serving as possible. If you are not consuming it right a way add plastic wrap directly on to the guacamole to prevent the oxidation process and refrigerate.
